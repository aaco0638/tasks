Value:

office 365 brought collobaration tools so we could all comunicate and create documents for better coordination.
google admin console controlled permissions for all staff in the doe in terms of google related products/services.
ibm verify console controlled permissions and login credentials for all staff in the doe. 
ARS controlled what permissions someone or their device was allowed to access and what level of access they had. 
intunes controlled device enrollement and permissions. 

cloud computing is very broad but the doe depended on a lot of cloud services to keep everything running, including a virtual environment to do work anywhere.
